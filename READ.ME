The rules of the game are as follows : 
- Every node must participate in the game. If a node is connected with another node, then that node cannot connect back to the previous. 
- The arcs are single-directional.
- We only deal with odd number of nodes. We cannot have even number of nodes.
- The minimum number of nodes required is 5
Problem faced : 
The program draws the graph very well for every odd number of node above 4, except for 9 nodes where it misses some arcs 
from node 2 and node 3(for node 2 and 3). With 9 nodes, the program misses to draw arcs for node 2 and 3 skipping 3 nodes
